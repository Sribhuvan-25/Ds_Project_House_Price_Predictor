This project focuses on predicting house prices in the city of Bengaluru. LinearRegression algorithms haves been used to build the optimum Machine Learning model.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, matplotlib

-> Developed a machine learning model by testing out Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree algorithms and came to conlcusion that the optimum model is achieved by using Linear regression. 

-> Achieved an accuracy of 86% using Linear regression algorithm.
